    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In my [previous post](https://atibaup.github.io/group-testing/), we discussed Dorfman's (2-stage) Group Testing strategy, whose setup can be quickly summarized by the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Notation convention](2nd_post_figures/simple_group_testing_setup.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Under that simplified setup, where we assumed that our test was **errorless** (that is, it generated no false negatives or false positives), we showed that one could obtain substantial efficiencies by applying the following \n",
    "**group testing** (also known as **pooled testing**) strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide the population into groups of $g$ individuals\n",
    "2. For each group, draw a specimen from each individual and pool them together.\n",
    "3. Run the test on the pooled sample. If the test turns positive, test each of the $g$ individuals in the pool, running a total of $g+1$ tests for that pool. Otherwise, if the test turns negative, label the $g$ individuals as non-infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, Dorfman showed that we could detect individuals infected with a low-prevalence disease with only a fraction of the tests needed to test individually the whole population. **For example, for a disease with a prevalence of 1%, we could identify the infected individuals by only running 1/5th of the tests necessary to test the whole population**. In other words, **if we have a limited number of tests, we could screen 5 times as many people**: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Notation convention](2nd_post_figures/savings.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, during the derivation of the above charts, we hid a couple of important details under the rug: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We assumed that the **testing procedure was errorless**, and \n",
    "2. That the test results within and across groups were **statistically independent.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we relax the first assumption and consider the situation were the test procedure is noisy, under a pretty generic statistical model of test errors. Of course this topic has already received some attention in the abundant group testing literature, see for example \\[1\\] for a recent review on the results obtained so far under the assumption of negligible or no dilution effect. For the study of errors induced by dilution of the sample, \\[2\\] considered a model of error under the dilution of limited practical appeal. The approach described here is closer to that of \\[3\\], derived in the context of analyzing dilution in pooled samples for HIV screening. "

    "## Characterizing noisy tests\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original Dorfman setup, it is implicitly assumed that there exist a methodology to, given a sample from an individual or a group of individuals, determine whether the sample contains the biomarker of interest, say, a syphilis antigen. This is what we call an errorless or noiseless test: a test that perfectly identifies the presence or absence of a given biomarker, without error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this is an unrealistic assumption: almost all tests that depend on measuring physical quantities are subject to (at least) measurement error, and hence they are not perfect. Luckily, modelling decision-making under uncertainty has been the bread and butter of statistics for almost 100 years. \n",
    "\n",
    "To characterize a test with error, we will need to define two additional quantities:\n",
    "* a **test statistic**, which we will usually denote by a random variable $s$,\n",
    "* a **decision threshold**, which we will denote by a deterministic value $\\eta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test statistic is typically a function of the quantity we measure. For example, in the Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) assays used to detect the presence of viral RNA in a sample, the test statistic is a function of the number of thermocycles needed for the fluorescence of a sample to exceed a given threshold. This statistic is a (non-linear) function of the underlying quantitiy of interest, which is the concentration of viral RNA.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an observation for the test statistic, $s$, we can then define the outcome of the test as a Bernouilli random variable $t$ defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$t = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & s\\geq \\eta \\\\ 0 & \\mbox{otherwise}\\end{array}\\right.$,\n",
    "\n",
    "With this notation at hand, we are ready to characterize the statistical error that ensues from the fact that $s$ is a non-deterministic quantity. To do so, we typically define two quantities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Specificity**, which we will denote by $\\pi_0$ and define as $\\pi_0 = P\\left(t = 0 | i = 0 \\right)$, the probability of discarding an infection if the individual is healthy,\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **Sensitivity**, which we will denote by $\\pi_1$ and define as $\\pi_1 = P\\left(t = 1 | i = 1 \\right)$, the probability of detecting an infection if the individual is infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that in our setup $i$ denotes whether an individual is really infected or not, that is, the \"ground truth\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that our original errorless tests are a special case of this model, where both the sensitivity and the specificity are equal to $1$. That is the same as saying that there are no false negatives or false positives. On the other hand, when there is uncertainty, it is often impossible to achieve both perfect *sensitivity* and *specificity*. As we become more sensitive in detecting positives, increasing the *sensitivity*, we will have to accept a few false positives, that is, a decrease in *specificity*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to better understand how these quantities evolve as a function of the amount of uncertainty, we plot below the behavior of these quantities as a function of $\\eta$ and a specific instance of our model where $s | i \\sim  \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{i}, \\sigma_q\\right)$. As we can see, swapping over $\\eta$ generates a curve of $\\pi_0$ and $\\pi_1$, also known as [Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic). The [Area Under the Curve (AUC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_operating_characteristic#Area_under_the_curve) is a measure of how much error a test displays - the higher the variance the lower the Area Under the Curve.\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we formalize the problem set up, it can be healthy to ask ourselves what do we expect to happen when we start using a noisy testing procedure with pooled samples... Would we expect the expected number of tests to increase or decrease? Do we expect the amount of false positives/negatives to be larger or smaller than the individual testing strategy?\n",
    "\n",
    "At first sight, it's hard to imagine how errors could help in any way. But it's also easy to show that a noisy testing procedure could actually *reduce the expected number of tests, though at the expense of increasing the false negative rate*. To see this, consider the extreme case of a test with zero specificity, which always rejects all groups. We will only perform $\\frac{N}{g}$ tests, but we will have a terrible false negative rate (we won't identify any infection!). This very simple line of reasoning seems to suggest that errors can increase or decrease both the number of tests we end up performing as well as the performance of our estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's setup the problem now. We will need to expand the individual testing notation from the previous section and define:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\bar{i}_k$: a Bernouilli random variable denoting whether *anyone* in the group is infected or not, which we can analytically define as $\\bar{i}_k = \\max_{j \\in \\mathcal{G}_k} i_j$.\n",
    "* $\\bar{q}_k$: a real-valued random variable corresponding to the measurement of a bio-marker for the pooled sample corresponding to group $k$. In general, $\\bar{q}_k$ will be a function of $q_j, j \\in \\mathcal{G}_k$.\n",
    "* $\\bar{s}_k$: the group test statistic, which we will assume to take the form $\\bar{s}_k = f(\\bar{q}_k, \\epsilon)$ where $f$ is deterministic and $\\epsilon$ is iid noise.\n",
    "* $\\bar{t}_k$: the group test outcome, a Bernouilli random variable defined as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Group-Specificity**, which we will denote by $\\bar{\\pi}_0$ and define as  $\\bar{\\pi}_0 = P\\left(\\bar{t} = 0 | \\bar{i}_k = 0 \\right)$, that is, the probability of discarding a group if the whole group is healthy, and\n",

    "### Impact of dilution on group-specificity and group-sensitivity \n",
    "\n",
    "The first question we want to study is how the specificity and sensitivity of the pooled test are impacted by the dilution of a \"positive\" (infected) sample in a pool of $g-1$ \"healthy\" samples. At first sight, it seems that diluting an infected sample shouldn't help its group-sensitivity... Consider the extreme case where the group is so big that the concentration of the infected biomarker becomes negligible and thus it is impossible to detect anything. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to gain more understanding without resorting to computational tools, we will make a few additional simplifying assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We will assume that, conditional on the infection indicator, the biomarker measurements follow a Normal distribution $q_j | i_j \\sim  \\mathcal{N}\\left(\\mu_{i_j}, \\sigma_q\\right)$ parameterized by $\\mu_0, \\mu_1$ and $\\sigma_q$.\n",
    "2. We will also assume that the pooled biomarker measurement is equal to the average of biomarker measurements in the pool, that is $\\bar{q}_k = \\frac{1}{g}\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{G}_k} q_j$\n",
    "3. We will also assume that both the group and individual testing statistics, are defined by the following relation  $s = f\\left(q\\right)$ where $f$ is a monotonic function of its argument. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the last two assumptions seem reasonable: On one hand, if we are measuring concentrations of a given biomarker in a sample, when mixing the samples we would expect the resulting concentration to be the average of each member in the pool. On the other, a well-behaved test statistic should evolve montonically with the concentration of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under these additional assumptions we can define the **group-specificity** as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\bar{\\pi}_0 = P\\left(\\bar{t} = 0 | \\bar{i}_k = 0 \\right) = P\\left(\\bar{s}_k < \\bar{\\eta} | \\bar{i}_k = 0 \\right) = P\\left(f(\\bar{q}_k) < \\bar{\\eta} | \\bar{i}_k = 0 \\right) = P\\left(\\bar{q}_k < f^{-1}\\left(\\bar{\\eta}\\right) | \\bar{i}_k = 0 \\right)$\n",

    "\n",
    "We have seen that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can characterize the expected number of tests in this setup as a function of the **group-specificity** and the **group-sensitivity**. As expected, the number of tests will increase with lower specificity, and decrease with lower sensitivity.\n",
    "2. We have also characterized the effect of **dilution** on these quantities in a simple model that allows us to model the impact in the group-ROC as the group size increases\n",
    "3. We have characterized the **global** performance of the two-stage procedure, in terms of the **global-specificity** and the **global-sensitivity**, which depend on the first and second stage thresholds. We have characterized this performance in a simple Gaussian model and suggested a strategy to pick the operating thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a subsequent blog post we will investigate the second assumption underlying Dorfman's group testing: **\"The independence of the individuals within a group, as well as independence of the test's outcome across groups\"**."
